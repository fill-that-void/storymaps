# 1.map-timeline
Imagined building on the original "Stories in Maps" idea: map + timeline (for story telling).
 - It has a world map (OpenLayers)
 - ...with location & name of ancient settlement(s)
 - ...also a placeholder "time line" overlay xD
Has Hot Module Reloading (HMR) as provided by Vue3 + Vite... for a more realtime development experience, see [Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGqwXt90ZqA) :)

`npm run dev`
