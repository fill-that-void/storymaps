# Stories in Maps & Time

**You can** pan & **zoom**, with the left / middle mouse button.

## Timeline: 32x32
[Live demo](https://gorbiz.github.io/storymaps/timelines/32x32/index.html)

The idea is that `32 x 32 = 1024` ...very close to `1000`, let's floor it & tell a story!

The grid is representing the last 1 billion years, the last box (lower right) represents the last million years, it in turn has 32 x 32 boxes inside it, each of those represent 1000 years, next down 1 year... 8 hours, 30 seconds, 30 ms, 30 ¬µs etc...

## Timeline: Quadrants
‚ö†Ô∏è I don't like this, see [Issue #8](https://github.com/gorbiz/storymaps/issues/8)


[Live demo](https://gorbiz.github.io/storymaps/timelines/quads/index.html)

The idea here is much like the `32 x 32` grid but instead we have `2 x 2`, like this:

```
---------
| 1 | 2 |
---------
| 3 | 4 |
---------
```
This would allow for quadrants like:
- `4 mil.  years ~=` age of Homo.
- `1 mil.  years ~= ...`
- `250 000 years ~=` age of Homo Sapiens.
-  `_62 250 years ~=` the Cognitive Revolution (Yuval Noah Harari) & [Lion-man sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-man).
- `15 625 years ~=` Agriculture (a bit younger).
- `3 900 years ~=` Agrarian civilizations (a bit older), also ~2 Jesus (a unit of time).
- `977 years ~=` ...
- `244 years ~=` Scientific revolution... or more like the industrial üßê

So, you'll be off by a bit sometimes but it is not too far off. And each of the above would be represented by a square into which you could fit an image...

## Map-timeline
Not yet working on GitHub pages (https://gorbiz.github.io/storymaps/map-timeline/index.html), clone repo & read [README.md](/map-timeline/README.md) for instructions.

Looks something like this:
