# timeline 2D based on quadrants...

Drawing the lines like this seems stupid...
The same lines are drawn several times in different thiuckness...
Makes in unnecessarily slow...

Instead draw... smarter.
And probably don't draw what is too small to see (depending on zoom level).

`npm start` or just `chrome index.html`
